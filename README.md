It is small project made on MATLAB which can be  used to held elections at low level.
The project includes a GUI which shows the option of voting to 5 candidates. The GUI includes voting buttons to cast vote, result button to show results and reset to restart the system with new elections.
The project uses excel sheet as it`s data bases which checks all authenticattion of user.  Hope you find my mini project interesting.
